When I started going to the day school in Oraibi, we were given cotton union suits.	Then as soon as I got home from school, my mother told me to take off the white man's clothes.
5	mdp.39015046352020	00000070	Mother picked up the basket of tortillas, went to the plaza, where the crier called out notice of a trade.	One of the first women to respond traded for piki, and Henry ate heartily.	When his supplies of corn and beans were getting low, my father would take a blanket one hundred miles to Winslow, where he would trade it for ten dollars worth of flour, sugar, and salt, which he brought back on his donkey.
6	mdp.39015046352020	00000074	Mrs. Hopi brought out her peaches, and the amount would be settled — maybe two baskets or three baskets full of dried peaches for a hind quarter of mutton.	Perhaps Mrs. Navajo might think she was being shortchanged, so Mrs. Hopi would finally add another handful of peaches for good measure.	As Mrs. Navajo gave her assent, Mrs. Hopi took the meat to her house, and the next in line took up the bargaining.
7	mdp.39015046352020	00000060	After the corn was gathered and stored, then came the time for providing clothing for the family.	A native variety of cotton grown principally at Moenkopi was the sole raw material for Hopi looms during the pre-Spanish era.	When the Conquistadores came they brought with them herds of sheep, as well as the Catholic Fathers, who stayed on to carry out the saving of the souls of Hopis.

Some of the older men, including my father, who were considered responsible for the affairs of the village, were given a punitive sentence of a year in prison at Fort Huachuca in southern Arizona.	Yokeoma and Twashongniwa, leader of the Shungopovites, were deposed and sent to Fort Huachuca and were to be exiled from the Hopi reservation forever.
10	mdp.39015046352020	00000088	The Friendlies asked the white people to leave at once, saying they had been too long already; the interpreters called loudly and pushed the white mediators out of the doorway.	Quoting Miss Stanley, “The melee was beginning when I, the last pahana going out, found myself jostled into the plaza.	The streets entering the plaza seemed full of excited Hopis running toward the house we had just left, and I heard Ed Gannett advising me, 'Better get out of here; there's going to be a scrap.'”
11	mdp.39015046352020	00000102	He stayed there as long as he lived; all of which time he was 100 per cent Hostile, resenting and resisting with vigor every encroachment of the white man's culture.	Superintendents came and Superintendents went, but each newcomer found Yokeoma there, a thorn in his side.	He died in 1928 and directed that none should succeed him, especially not his son Dan.
12	mdp.39015046352020	00000116	I didn't know what they meant, and they didn't tell us any Christmas story.	The second year, Christmas was just the same as the year before, but I understood more of the English words.	Later they had programs and songs.
13	mdp.39015046352020	00000089	After evicting the Hostile men, the Friendlies went into each home and forcibly ejected each family, driving them out to join their menfolk on the other side of The Line.	A struggling stream of humanity – men, women, and children – poured out of their houses past Tewaquaptewa's house and out of the village, being shoved and dragged and pulled by Tewaquaptewa and his excited followers.	Those resisting had their clothing torn and were bruised and scratched; the majority went passively, carrying burdens, the men with set faces and the women and children frightened and crying.
14	mdp.39015046352020	00000207	When they got up, it developed that the government stockman was at the bottom of the heap and was the last to get to his feet.

He stopped and was working in Winslow when word came to him that his people were all sick with the flu, so he came on home to Bacabi to help.	He had been home for more than a month before he came to see me because it was such a sad time with so much sickness and death in every village.
17	mdp.39015046352020	00000200	Since the hospital was new and quite empty, they let Emory and me have one of the rooms.	Most of the Indians were afraid of the hospital and wouldn't bring in their sick.	Navajos will not go near a dead body or a place where one has died.
18	mdp.39015046352020	00000214	This work lasted more than three years.	Many of the workers were Navajos who could not speak English, so Emory learned the Navajo language.	He would be gone all week and come home for Saturday and Sunday.
19	mdp.39015046352020	00000148	A matron traveled with us.	Emory met us at the train in Phoenix, but I didn't know it.	He had been assigned by Dr. Breid to meet the train and escort the boys, walking from the Santa Fe depot on Fourth Avenue over to the streetcar line on Second Street and Washington, where he supervised their boarding the streetcar and rode out, way out, to the Indian School.
20	mdp.39015046352020	00000160	She was a good angel in my life from this time until she retired in 1925.	When I felt that I just had to get away from the tension in my home, I would go to the sewing room and find relief with Miss Abbott.	During the latter part of October an epidemic of influenza came to Hopi land.
21	mdp.39015046352020	00000150	Sometimes she would save a piece of pie or cake for me.	Clara, the other girl in the Brown home, had always been given the shirts to iron while I did the plain pieces, but when Clara was sick for a week Mrs. Brown found out that I could do fancy ironing too.	She let me run the whole house when she saw that I could do it.

We stayed in Lapwai until the end of the school year and would have liked to stay longer.	The superintendent wanted us to stay, but Olive got sick, even before school was out.
23	mdp.39015046352020	00000192	In due time my first baby, a little girl, was born.	We named her Joy, and she opened the door of joy that a baby brings to its parents, “out of God's wondrous ways.”	When a birth is imminent, all the Hopi family leave the house, and the prospective mother is left with a male relative as her helper.
24	mdp.39015046352020	00000151	Emory was often sent.	He would go to town on the streetcar and look around the streets, but sometimes they would get as far away as Glendale or Peoria.	Then Emory would have to go by train, and when he found them bring them back and deliver the boys to their disciplinarian and the girls to the matron.
25	mdp.39015046352020	00000147	I could not go without the consent of my parents, which they would not give.	I was joined by a few others of like mind, and we begged the Superintendent, Mr. Leo Crane, to let us go to Phoenix Indian School.	We even suggested, “You could say we are a little older than we are.”
26	mdp.39015046352020	00000153	This is what I did during my second summer in Phoenix.	The third and last summer I worked again for Mrs. Scott, who had asthma.	She left everything for me to do.
27	mdp.39015046352020	00000152	This was later than my time.	In World War II Sam received a recognition for outsmarting the “Japs” in the jungles of the South Pacific, running communication wires, so his training did not go for naught.	I still loved to study and learn.

32	mdp.39015046352020	00000168	As he grew older he had lived in Bacabi, with his cousin Susie and her husband, who was his godfather, during the summers that he was home, helping in whatever way he could.	Susie invited us to come to her home, and Emory's uncles and cousins all helped put in for the cotton and food and were the hosts for us.	After we decided to get married, I spent every minute that I could grinding in preparation for feeding the wedding guests.
33	mdp.39015046352020	00000084	I thought they were mistaken; they had misunderstood Mr. Lemmon, ...	No, indeed; they had not misunderstood Mr. Lemmon; he knew what Washington was going to do, and he had told them again and again.	If I didn't know it, that showed that I didn't know what Washington was about; so why did I say that I was from Washington, and had charge of the Indians, when I was ignorant of this program?
34	mdp.39015046352020	00000085	Tewaquaptewa, whose following was slightly outnumbered by the Hostiles, received private information of a plot to assassinate him; indeed he understood that the Shungopovis, rather than the Oraibians, were the instigators of the plot.	Tewaquaptewa called his council together that night at his house on the northern edge of the village, September 6, and they spent the night preparing for an attack on the Hostiles in the morning.	During the night he sent word to Yokeoma and his followers, who were also in council, that the Shungopovis would have to leave at once and that anyone taking their part must leave with them.
35	mdp.39015046352020	00000078	Lololama's right-hand man at this time was Yokeoma, who stood firmly for following the old traditions.	As Lololama had said in Washington, his people were blind and deaf to any change in their ways.	In due time Yokeoma parted ways with Lololama with a following of more than half the village.
36	mdp.39015046352020	00000093	They were told that all property of every description was still the property of the Hostiles.	It was further decided that two interpreters, Tewaquaptewa, a man from Moenkopi, and the people representing Washington should meet with four Hostile leaders, where an ultimatum would be delivered by Tewaquaptewa, as follows: The Hostiles should move on to the Hotevilla spring and remain there only until Washington could be heard from.	The Friendlies wished them to move farther away.
37	mdp.39015046352020	00000079	Reinforcements had to be summoned to accomplish the vaccination and fumigation order.	This situation was unbearable to the Friendlies of Shungopovi, and taking matters into their own hands they forced several of the most difficult Hostile families out of the village.	The exiles went over to Oraibi where they were welcomed and taken in by the Oraibi Hostiles.
38	mdp.39015046352020	00000081	In humiliation the kachinas turned back and retired from the plaza to the resting place and there disrobed.	This was a deliberate insult on the part of the Friendlies, with all eyes upon them.

39	mdp.39015046352020	00000080	If the Friendlies were the sponsors, the Hostiles refused to be spectators.	In all this, the Shungopovis were a most disturbing factor.	The Home Dance comes in July.

389	uc1.32106006887498	00000094	There was a mountain towards Canada.	I looked at the horizon it was for a long time because I thought it looked like Kaweshtima at home and I had left a couple months back and was lonely for my son and wife.	We'd driven on narrow roads from Calais.

394	uva.x000083545	00000113	We kept doing this, for mother needed the practice.	In 1931, my brother-in-law Dolores got sick at the ranch near Tempe during Lent and died the same year during Holy Week.	He was brought to Pascua on Good Friday.
395	uva.x000083545	00000098	When the job came to the highway crossing, the camp was moved to Morrison.	In the same way the work carried to Morrison, where the camp was, the work train coming every day with the steam shovel and empty flatcar.	All the old steel was salvaged for junk, and the rails for secondhand grade.
396	uva.x000083545	00000073	The God of the white man was revealed by the missionary priests, who translated prayers into Yaqui.	I am happy that many Yaquis follow the Christian faith, so there is no return to the practices of the yoaniya, because we are no longer as susceptible to it.	Being with these Río Yaqui Yaquis, seeing their amulets and hearing their stories almost made me accept the yoaniya, but the influence of seataka was stronger.
397	uva.x000083545	00000067	His true name, as we knew him, was Rafael Muñoz.	The name Juan Pistola had been assigned to him at Durazo's slaughterhouse because his broken thumb was bent at the joint, making it look like he was holding a pistol.	The border incident and designation of Pistola as chief caused a controversy among Yaquis north and south.
398	uva.x000083545	00000065	He asked me to eat, and I had rabbit which was roasted on open, live coals.	These people were from Altez, a Papago village.	I joined them because we were neighbors at the camp.
399	uva.x000083545	00000059	You can sense the perfume from a long distance.	My father told me how the Indians knew God by this perfume.	Before the white man, the Yaquis saw God in this creation.

401	uva.x000083545	00000111	She had a recording of the sermon at her home.	The sermon was recorded from the actual Easter farewell sermon, the author being the Pascua Head Maestro, Ignacio Alvarez.	I would listen and write it, first in Yaqui, then English.
402	uva.x000083545	00000138	We would not know where we were going until we reached our destination, but I knew when we left Los Angeles that we were on the Santa Fe Railroad which goes straight through the state.	After San Bernardino, we crossed the Sierra Nevada.	Having traveled all night, we were in mid-state.
403	uva.x000083545	00000110	"I chose two passages for language illustration ""Vempo hiba nau molmolti noka” [They only together in low voices spoke), and “santo taewa keki cantelam venasi vete"" (burning like birthday cake candles)."	A few years after this language study, Dr. Spicer recommended me to Mrs. Painter.	She had previously asked for a description of the Deer Dance, so I brought it to this first interview with her in 1948.
404	uva.x000083545	00000058	Our father was not working Sundays, so he told us about the way he came to Arizona.	He crossed from Mexico at Douglas, going through Cochise County to Willcox on to Bowie and on to Safford, San Carlos, and Globe.	In our camp, we had a large tent to live in.
405	uva.x000083545	00000074	When she was older and married to Juan Pistola, she bore him a daughter who was eventually married to a gambler who was shot by a Negro at Jaynes.	Like Julio, Juan Pistola was illiterate; however, he was conscious of the need for education, so he sent us big boys to public school.	Shortly before this, I had applied for a job with my father's foreman and was hired, so I went to the section house.
406	uva.x000083545	00000060	Another story he told was of Peo, which means Pedro.	Peo was a big liar and deceiver all over the eight villages of the Río Yaqui.	One day a priest came riding a mule.
407	uva.x000083545	00000128	Fernando was with me, and I arranged with him to take her to the hospital.	It was late afternoon when the ambulance came and took her to Southern Methodist, where Miss Richey had made arrangements.	The next morning I went to see my mother.
408	uva.x000083545	00000100	They were always in heated argument.	Late one Sunday afternoon, when the foreman had gone to town, Calixto came running into my room, because they were fighting.	I ran to their house and found the little man had the big man cornered, wielding a mean knife at the big man's belly.
409	uva.x000083545	00000115	I had been sitting over the running disk and saw how it had happened, so my statement was this: “It could have been avoided if we had first stopped the motor, then wiped off the grease on the disk that caused the slipping friction wheel.”	After this severe blow, Joe continued on the job, directing work and always cheerful as before.	He only kept his arm in a sling for a short time.
410	uva.x000083545	00000101	This perspective I had also enjoyed in the Sacramento River canyon the year before when I arrived in the Mott section from Tucson.	My memories of Tucson, while I was in Mistletoe, were of the toasted evening horizon, the pink rose color dabbed on the Catalina cliffs.	All this went on until winter came, then Christmas season.
411	uva.x000083545	00000129	Just after the burial, Juan Gonzáles came.	This was Juan Se'elai, who had been married to my sister on the ranch near Tempe after the death of my brother-in-law Dolores.	He came to take her back to the ranch because he had promised for her kids' sake.
412	uva.x000083545	00000075	The Garcías were living at Pascua plaza, and fiestas were held at their place.	For this reason the site was selected, and Pascua Village was planned to bring all Yaquis together in one place suitable for ceremonies.	My mother chose a lot next to Ignacio Maestro, and my brother and I built her a typical Yaqui homestead.
413	uva.x000083545	00000063	Being back together with my two sisters, we worked where work was until war started to put us to work for the railroad.	When the war started, a work train was assembled to take laborers northwest on the Southern Pacific track to Jaynes, Rillito, Redrock, Picacho, Casa Grande, and Maricopa.	It was a commuter train, going out in the morning and coming back to Tucson in the evening with extra gang number ten, campo diez.
414	uva.x000083545	00000077	.	My uncle, Félix Esperanza, was also an assistant under the same foreman, but in the Tucson division.	In 1923, after we had worked in the Deming camp one year, we heard that the Río Yaqui Yaquis were being given transportation to the fiesta in Magdalena, so having the money, my brother went to the fiesta in October and brought the whole family back home.
415	uva.x000083545	00000117	Still much later, he became general foreman of all the maintenance-of-way camps.	In 1933 I was sent from Yuma to extra gang number one at Mohawk where Gailey was now foreman of the camp.	We came, not doing construction work, just raising track, putting new gravel and new ties, and tamping with air tie-tampers.

417	uva.x000083545	00000116	Because of lack of knowledge, he was not doing it right.	Joe Cataleno climbed up to show the new man how to keep the cable in place.	While he held it in place, the cable whipped, and the bar hit Joe in the head, knocking him off the flatcar to the ground.
418	uva.x000083545	00000171	And it so happens that I'm paralyzed on my left side, but we could not coordinate.	Manuel was an old Tucsonan.	We talked about our times at Silver Lake Dam and El Ojito de Agua, and the days we spent going up the Santa Cruz River to El Mesquital Los Reales.
419	uva.x000083545	00000165	I did not know it, but it happened to me.	Seeing this, the boys took me home to Fernando's in a car.	I knew I had need of hospitalization, so I reported to the hospital.
420	uva.x000083545	00000164	At that time all Indians were called to participate in a presentation in the high school auditorium.	Mrs. Painter took us Yaquis with her.	She also took us to her home to have a party.
421	uva.x000083545	00000170	After the death and burial of my nephew, I remained with Fernando.	Then summer came, and I could not stay comfortable, so in June, I moved in with my niece Yzabel again.	The afternoon I arrived, notice came to us of the death of a distant relative.
422	uva.x000083545	00000206	However, the influence of his brother's advice is suggested in the painstaking work of translation from the Yaqui which he carried out in conjunction with the Maestro who delivered the original sermon.	Refugio worked long hours on not only the translation but also on interpretive notes, to which he gave his own characteristic literary flavor.	The work was published nearly thirty years after this brother's deathbed prophecy.
423	uva.x000083545	00000210	When they dressed, they roasted the meat and ate, and soon they were on their way home.	Pacisco was glad, and how much more glad he was to have his body again.	He was very much disappointed; he had tried to escape on several occasions, but he was always surrounded by all the beasts of the jungle which threatened to devour him, and the only manner of escape was to go back to Marita.
424	uva.x000083545	00000204	Culminating the intense ceremonial activities of Holy Week is a farewell sermon by the Maestro of the village.	In this case, the Maestro reviewed the role of the Fariseo soldiers and the masked Chapayekas, who, during the Holy Saturday ceremonies, make a ritual attack on the chapel but are finally overcome by the forces of good, who shower them with flowers and bring them to surrender before the altar.	The complete ceremony, which takes place from Ash Wednesday through the last week of Lent, is in many ways similar to a medieval mystery play, but with elements also of the morality play.
425	uva.x000083545	00000199	The Mexican government decreed that Yaquis could return safely to their eight pueblos on the Río Yaqui.	Shortly after Loreto Hiama's return to Sonora, Savala's mother set out by wagon and rail for her home village of Potam and was warmly welcomed by her uncle with a feast.	But it was only a visit; the Savala family was well settled in Pascua.
426	uva.x000083545	00000198	The unrest and persecution in their early adulthood had also disrupted their contact with traditional Yaqui life.	While they knew and told Refugio the myth of Seahamoot and some other stories little touched by Christianity, they knew little of the Yaqui version of Bible stories.	Hiama on the other hand was deeply involved in the Christian tradition that went with Yaqui ritual and conveyed these stories to his nephew, awakening a deep interest in Refugio that would later influence his writing of stories.
427	uva.x000083545	00000205	Well enough for baseball, he was able to return to his work, this time for the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad.	The 1925 Polvo branch project Savala worked on changed the route of the EPSW track heading out of Tucson from due east to south, then east again.	The track, originally laid in 1880, headed directly east toward El Paso, passing the later site of Davis Monthan Air Force Base.
428	uva.x000083545	00000163	Above all Divine help is my salvation forevermore, amen.	Besides Max's yard, I was also doing Mom Wilson's yard.	By this time she had become very sick and bed-ridden.
429	uva.x000083545	00000177	The occupation led most families to leave their native villages, because they would not accept domination by the Mexicans.	Some Yaquis became guerilla warriors in the Bacatete Mountains, while others sought refuge by blending in with the peon population on haciendas throughout Sonora.	Yaquis who were caught by federal troops were deported to the sugarcane fields of Oaxaca or the brutal henequen plantations of Yucatán.
430	uva.x000083545	00000161	A layer of cement was to go on top of the blocks, a job I did by dragging the molder along the top of the wall to make it oval.	Maxwell wanted the wall to be white, which I did with white Bondex, dabbing it all around the wall with a big lime brush.	When the wall was all Bondexed and white, we laid a floor in the ramada, and a barbeque pit was built of hewn stone.
431	uva.x000083545	00000149	My daily work was as a common laborer in section twenty-four of the Tucson section yard; however, I kept my appointments on the campus while working in the gang.	Dr. Spicer and Mrs. Painter were still working with me.	I read that the university was going to put on a radio program.*
432	uva.x000083545	00000150	Harry Behn, radio operator for the University of Arizona station, was announcing.	"He said, “This morning our guest is Ray... Ray..."" until he could say “Refugio."""	I was supposed to talk, and I hate to talk about myself, but at noon the program went on, and my script was my own story about duck hunting without a gun.
433	uva.x000083545	00000178	Drifting north, he spent a short period near Magdalena, then set out for the United States with his wife, Tomasa Flores, a native of Potam, another of the eight Yaqui pueblos, and their three children, Agustín, Agustina, and Encarnación, Martin's son by a previous marriage (Spicer 1936: fieldnotes).	In Arizona, Martín Savala, like many Yaqui refugees before him, found work with the railroad, laboring as a section hand between Nogales and Benson.	Like so many of their fellow refugees, the Savalas had a deep hatred for the Mexican government, and, as unofficial immigrants into the United States, an enduring fear of deportation back to persecution in Mexico.
434	uva.x000083545	00000192	Since no elections were held to place Pistola in his leadership position, many Yaquis refused him allegiance or support, causing dissention within the community in Tucson, particularly on the issue of aid to Yaquis in Sonora.	"The friction was intensified when, in the spring of 1919, a youth from Mesquital Village was killed during a fiesta at which a rather loosely organized and unofficial ""police” force formed by Pistola was in charge of keeping order."	Pistola was exonerated in court of any responsibility for the killing, but he lost his following in the southern Tucson communities.
435	uva.x000083545	00000145	My relief would come at noon, and we would go to the base for the rest of the day.	The guard squadron had permanent KP duty, day and night.	Off duty, we could get a pass and go to town evenings.
436	uva.x000083545	00000147	I took a taxi and came home, where I changed into civilian clothes sent from the reception center but kept the GI shoes.	The reception was food and Yaqui music, my uncle playing violin with a Mayo harpist.	My cousin took me around to see our friends in his car.
437	uva.x000083545	00000153	The color Mom chose was emerald green.	It was a good color for a Pascola ramada, the carport being on the sunrise side.	Mrs. Wilson got very sick with cancer.
438	uva.x000083545	00000184	Yaquis, Mexicans, and Papago Indians settled together in this small area.	Barrio Anita and a ranch called Tierras Flojas were Yaqui settlements north of the city.	The other communities Refugio mentions – Mesquital and Mesquitalitono longer exist.
439	uva.x000083545	00000191	Late in 1917, a band of eleven men set out with arms for Sonora, believing that the fighting going on there was an uprising of the Yaqui people against the Mexican government.	They were stopped by a detachment of U.S. Cavalry from Fort Huachuca and brought back to Tucson to face charges of violating the neutrality of the United States by attempting to carry arms into Mexico.	This incident caused much agitation and concern among Tucson Yaquis and a man named Juan Pistola (Juan Muñoz) acted as their spokesman several times during the trial in February of 1918.
440	uva.x000083545	00000152	When I had the ground cleared where the chicken house had been, I started digging the trenches to pour the foundation in.	I had enough house building experience, and on this Mom Wilson depen led.	On my own plan, I squared up the corners for a rectangular wall.
441	uva.x000083545	00000146	I was entirely on my own on the trip but in familiar territory from the start.	We rode all that night and the next day until we reached Klamath Falls at ten o'clock.	From here I knew which would be the next town.
442	uva.x000083545	00000208	A young Indian cowboy went far into the Mayo Indian country where he, as it is always the case, was in love with a fair Indian maiden.	Her name was Marita, which means Mary in Mayo; the young man was a Yaqui Indian; therefore his name was Pacisco, which means Frank in Yaqui.	This man did not know the Mayos very well, but he loved Marita just the same.
443	uva.x000083545	00000142	When we returned from the rifle range, we four were on the list to move, not knowing where, only that the move was sure.	The evening of December 27, we boarded a train at Fresno, going north to the Tracy line.	We came to the Oakland piers at night and from there went on to Martinez and across the bay to Benicia.
444	uva.x000083545	00000181	In a desert valley surrounded by four ranges of mountains, the city had been an Indian village before the Coronado expedition and had served as a Spanish presidio before the United States annexation of the Gadsden Purchase in 1853.	On March 20, 1880, the Southern Pacific Railroad connected Tucson to the rest of the nation, beginning an era of rapid growth (Arizona Daily Star 1975: 23).	With the hardships of desert travel eased by the railroad, businesses flourished and population increased rapidly, drawn by a healthful climate and a prosperous economy.
445	uva.x000083545	00000195	"Anglo hopes that the village would become the center of a “Yaqui Nation"" in Arizona were not realized."	Those families already established in the South Tucson villages of Libre and Mesquital did not respond to the plan, and the breach between Pistola's followers and opponents widened.	However, the village did draw many Yaquis, some of whom were already squatting on the site, and before Pistola's death in 1922, it had become a wellestablished ceremonial center.
446	uva.x000083545	00000194	When Refugio returned from working with the Río Yaqui hands on the railroad just east of Yuma, his original sympathy with Juan Pistola's endeavors led to a direct relationship with the leader, who was living with the Savala family at the time.	Pistola was a Mayo Indian from Sonora just south of the Río Yaqui area.	Having worked in mines in Sonora, he had drifted into the United States around 1900.
447	uva.x000083545	00000180	The New Mexico and Arizona, the Twin Buttes Railroad, the El Paso and Southwestern, and the Tucson-Nogales railroads also employed Yaqui refugees (Myrick 1975: 269).	However, all of these lines were eventually absorbed by the Southern Pacific.	Refugio's father was an extra gang section hand, so he and his family lived in rail cars, moving from area to area as construction and maintenance of the line required.
448	uva.x000083545	00000157	But this time I would not be returning.	The passenger train that went on the Phoenix line from Wellton came to Ligurta.	To get the passenger train that went on the Phoenix line, we rode first on the truck to Wellton.
449	uva.x000083545	00000143	One porter said we would be in Portland by morning, and it happened that we arrived there and went into the waiting room.	We had traveled the Cascade route, thereby missing the Siskiyou route.	The divide started at Black Buttes below Shasta City.

452	uva.x000083545	00000196	The article in the June 29, 1941, Arizona Daily Star was actually headlined, “Yaqui Poet Produces Belles Lettres Here.”	The following is an excerpt from that lengthy article by Bernice Cosulich, reporter and Tucson historian: Refugio Savala is a Yaqui of Pascua village and a section hand on the Southern Pacific Railroad system.	For all his aristocratic manner and cultivated speech, one would not suspect that this quiet man of 38 years is a literary giant among his tribesmen.
453	uva.x000083545	00000183	Until the water table began to recede, the area just southwest of the city had provided water for both practical and leisure use.	The Silver Lake region was the location of two major recreational centers until floods in the Santa Cruz river washed away dams in 1900.	Even after the disastrous flood which engulfed the Elysian Groves amusement center and Warner's Bath Houses, a dam created a lake for picnicking and swimming where the tall cottonwood trees shaded West Silver Lake Road (later West 29th Street), which Refugio calls El Callejón.
454	uva.x000083545	00000197	"“He could have been a maestro,"" they say of him, remembering his neglect of Yaqui ceremonial dances and rituals in which he might have been their leader and teacher."	“He is a wanderer,” they add, recalling his travels with section gangs throughout the Southwest and out of work.	They, no more than Walt Whitman's family when the author first finished Leaves of Grass, would think it worthwhile reading Refugio's manuscripts....
455	uva.x000083545	00000140	Only other MPs saw us new MPs leave Wichita Falls.	The first city we arrived at was Amarillo.	There was a curfew in this city for soldiers, but the MPs seeking out latestayers did not bother us when we told them we were from the train.
456	uva.x000083545	00000154	After I had the yard all in shape, I wondered what would come next.	I had kept in touch with the SP shop foreman for possible jobs, and I was assigned to a bridge gang at Ligurta in the Yuma district.	I took the regular evening passenger train number forty-three.

On Sunday evening I went to my niece's tent while her husband was having supper and told them about what was done in Guadalupe and Higley and all about how I went to be with Agustina and her family.	Making my talk brief, I went in to get in bed.
460	uva.x000083545	00000127	This time we shipped to Mescal west of Benson.	We worked this district January through February, then moved to Red Rock, where we had worked on the Silverbell branch.	The boss had the same old crews together again.

After my father was with us six months, the railroad coming from El Paso claimed the land where our home was, and also the Coronados', so we had to move again.	This time it was to the north part of town, across the tracks from Barrio Anita, because my parents preferred the Yaqui side.
472	uva.x000083545	00000082	The men said that it looked like a pack mule carrying a canvas water bag, because the water container was built on top of the engine between the smokestack and cab.	When orders were given, the men started tearing up the old yard all of the way down to Prison Hill.	We had no track machinery then, so all the work was done by hand.

The tiny berry is like that of the cumaro, an Arizona tree found in abundance on the east side of the Santa Cruz River.	Between Sahuarita and San Xavier, south of Tucson, this tree grows up as tall as telephone posts.
482	uva.x000083545	00000136	These Benito disliked.	He was always talking of going home to his parents in Cochise, but he was never ready to quit his job for that.	Nelson, a white man who was in the gang, was also rooming with us.
483	uva.x000083545	00000137	So I passed 1941, a little here, a little there, at home with Fernando.	One floating gang came to Jaynes, six miles west of town.	I worked in this camp to the yard limit and walked to work.
484	uva.x000083545	00000094	Being August, the cold was not yet severe.	We had been working steadily for one week when a report came to the foreman from the Forest Service unit that we should go to fight a forest fire at the foot of Mount Shasta.	We made all preparations to wait for a truck to come for us.
485	uc1.32106008463017	00000013	I walked beside the stone that bore your name and date and felt the threat of history give rise to sudden chill, like wind from unseen creek.	Ancestral bones lie in anonymity in this New World except that History called you Christian and your name kill-in-war-with-spear vouched for you.	Grave Paul, Your name as pale as northern Tamarack in fall, and names of all born then or since are played like coins in games of chance.

487	uc1.32106008463017	00000014	With Sitting Bull dead it was easier said.	And so the sadly shrouded songs of poets, ash-yellowed, crisp with age arise from drums to mark in fours three times the sacred ways that prayers are listened for; an infant girl stares past the night, her beaded cap of buckskin brightens Stars and Stripes that pierce her mother's breast; Hokshina, innocent as snow birds, tells of Ate's blood as red as plumes that later decorate the posts of death.	"“Avenge the slaughtered saints,” beg mad-eyed poets everywhere as if the ""bloody Piemontese"" are real and really care for liberty of creed; the blind who lead the blind will consecrate the Deed, indeed!"
488	uc1.32106008463017	00000024	He stepped upon the porch and lit a cigarette, the match illuminating the fine, delicate bones of his deeply pocked, scarred face.	"Holding the match close for a moment, Uncle said, to no one in particular, “A car's coming."""	Cars were rarely seen here on this country road this late in the evening.
489	uc1.32106008463017	00000025	As he tapped on the screen door, the Mother appeared and the freckled man quickly opened the door, stepped inside and held it open for the two smiling women who accompanied him to squeeze inside and in front of him.	"“I'm Sister Bernice,” began the plumper of the two women, ""and this is Sister Kate ...?”"	Her voice trailed off as if she had asked a question.
490	uc1.32106008463017	00000022	During this drying process the children would be set to fanning the flies away with long willows, a task which held attention a surprisingly brief time.	Bored, they would run off in pursuit of more imaginative pastimes only to be called back as soon as Grandmother discovered their absence.	Also at the rear of the house was a large tipi, the color of smoke at the top, streaked with rain, lined with cow hides, comfortable, shaded in late afternoon by the lone pine tree which was, itself, a stranger to the hot plains country of the Dakotah, itself a survivor of the days when Bureau employees lived there.
491	uc1.32106008463017	00000021	Uncle's son often lived with The Family as did the Grandmother's half-sister and her husband and their two granddaughters.	The Family was part of a small community which had reassembled itself at this place after the violent Diaspora and Displacement which was endured by this ancient tribe for several generations, the Family all the more closely knit because of this tragedy of recent history as well as the more practical problem of long distances to the few sparce surrounding towns settled a hundred years before by whites anxious to possess land and become rich.	The year was 1935 and this was a place where strangers, though alien and undesirable, even called to'ka, were largely unthreatening and often ignored, and where strange events were witnessed with inexplicable but characteristic tolerance.
492	wu.89060396363	00000066	I'll never forget him.'	'But he couldn't speak English.	It must have been pretty awkward,' I put in.
493	wu.89060396363	00000112	With a flourish he heaped the bowl with flour, added salt, and rummaged in the grub-box for the baking powder.	While his back was turned, McGinty, the opportunist, spied the abandoned bowl.	She came at a dead gallop, zoomed through the air, and landed plop in the middle, sending flour in all directions.
494	wu.89060396363	00000107	I had even ceased to write any more.	I accepted Dave's invitation to tea, and while in his tent I turned the Macs loose.	I expected them to make a dash for the lake, but they were content to lie in my lap until Archie returned.
495	wu.89060396363	00000065	Where was ya headed for?'	'Cobalt,' Archie answered, and filled him in on the details.	‘And with my first earnings, I'll pay you and Ag-Nu for all the trouble I've been....!
496	wu.89060396363	00000111	The men, on hearing our plans, were more concerned for our welfare.	They informed us that the Touladi country had been heavily 'cut and there was nothing there but slash.	Archie looked sick – this was bad news.
497	wu.89060396363	00000139	What giddy excitement there was in camp as we packed.	Even Jelly Roll seemed to sense that something was in the offing, and there surely was, for we were going to the North Pole to stake our bonanza!	But when our gear was loaded on the wagon and we were driving towards the station, we looked back at Elephant Mountain and thought of Mac and Mac.
498	wu.89060396363	00000138	The news of how we had got it travelled through the town like wildfire, and those kind and friendly people came to congratulate Archie, as happy for us as if we were their own kin.	There was another letter from Country Life, asking Archie to write a book.	Although he was rather unnerved concerning this, he replied that he would try to do it.
499	wu.89060396363	00000064	Timagami in those days was little more than a fur-trading post.	The population consisted of Indians, white trappers, and the odd prospector coming in for supplies.	During the winter it was almost a ghost town, but in the spring, when the rivers and lakes were free of ice, the trappers with their families would come pouring in from their hunting grounds, loaded with furs.
500	wu.89060396363	00000070	At this time, Archie also told me about Marie Gerard.	Marie was waiting tables at the boarding house where Archie usually stayed when in Bisco.	It was late September in 1914, and time for him to leave for his hunting ground.
501	wu.89060396363	00000060	As Archie talked, a group of snowshoe rabbits, attracted by the light of the fire, appeared atop the snowbank, and there they were, sitting in a row as if they too were listening.	We returned to Pony Hall the evening before Archie was to take me to Forsythe and to the train that would take me home.	Archie made a valiant effort to be bright and gay, but finally ceased trying, and I too remained silent as I collected my things and began to pack.
502	wu.89060396363	00000128	There's no more places to look.	It's the end of Mac and Mac.	And take a look at this foot.'
503	wu.89060396363	00000100	I loved them and meant to keep them.	It wouldn't be easy to get Archie to agree to this, because his fur catch was small, and to make it harder for me to have my way about the little creatures was the fact that a man in eastern Quebec had started a beaver farm, making beaver more valuable alive than dead.	Wanting to discover just how difficult it was going to be, I said, 'They're sure going to make great pets, aren't they?'
504	wu.89060396363	00000114	After he left, I once more bitterly wondered if we would ever leave this cruel way of earning a livelihood.	I had the same sinking feeling that had made my last months on the Marque so miserable.	To lighten my mood, I slipped into my snowshoe bridles and hiked the three or four miles down the portage to where we had a cache.
505	wu.89060396363	00000129	‘I'll have to do something guiding, maybe.	I hear there's a resort – Metis Beach, wherever that is.'	'But what about Mac and Mac?
506	wu.89060396363	00000061	In 1906 he had arrived in Toronto, where he worked as a clerk in a men's-wear shop.	Hating every minute of it, he couldn't wait until he had enough money to take him to Cobalt, where there had been a recent discovery of silver.	(Cobalt, Ontario, 330 miles north of Toronto, was then one of the richest silver districts in the world.)
507	wu.89060396363	00000049	This was a missive that Mary Robinson had written for Naharrenou when the band of rebels saw the writing on the wall and knew their fight was about over.	Kanistonou and Naharrenou had urged Mary Robinson to return to her own people before it was too late.	On her adamant refusal to leave, Naharrenou had asked her to write a letter to a relative of his in Oka, who had preferred to stay there under foreign laws and restrictions rather than join the fight for freedom.
508	wu.89060396363	00000063	Archie thought at last he would know where he was and looked expectantly at the door.	He saw an Indian girl, tall and slender, coming towards him with a bowl in her hand.	She was wearing a long, full skirt, a bright, flowered blouse, and a colourful kerchief draped loosely about her shoulders.
509	wu.89060396363	00000117	During this period he found another pastime.	He began to make an Indian war-bonnet from the feathers of an owl that had been caught in a fox-set when we were in the Jumping Caribou country.	When the headpiece was finished, he carved an Indian head from a block of wood and painted the friendship sign on its face.
510	wu.89060396363	00000102	Archie hadn't brought up the fate of the beaver since the night of the big quarrel, and this silence worried me, since 1 knew that once Archie had made up his mind about anything, it was useless to discuss it further.	We started the journey to Doucet.	The first day was something awful.
511	wu.89060396363	00000116	‘But the kittens are fighting over something.	They do sound exactly like Mac and Mac,' I insisted.	He set the last trap and came forward.
512	wu.89060396363	00000076	Jim took this good naturedly, chuckling as he told Albert that that was more than he could say, as he wouldn't be able to tell what Albert looked like until he'd gone at least fifteen rounds with a bar of soap.	Albert showed neither pain nor pleasure at this repartee.	He waited patiently until Jim's laughter had ceased, and then spoke.
513	wu.89060396363	00000165	The message read, 'Come immediately.	I will meet you in Winnipeg – wire when you will be there.	Not having a thing to pack, I pushed off and didn't let any moss gather on my paddle getting out to the railroad.
514	wu.89060396363	00000159	My sympathies, however, were short-lived, for the butler, having regained his composure, was surveying us with undisguised amusement and contempt.	There wasn't time for Archie to wipe that smirk off his face, because the Flagstones were coming forward to greet us; that is, they were till they stopped short in their tracks.	They too, I thought, expected us to turn up in ‘soup and fish.'
515	wu.89060396363	00000158	No thank you, I'm not going.'	'You are away out, Grey Owl,' said Sir Charles.	“Why, they are among the finest people I know.'
516	wu.89060396363	00000164	The tin box was again used to transport the beaver to the railroad station, where there was a 4' x 6' tank with bath, a drying-off platform, and an upper tier for living-quarters a magnificent affair.	Our friends, kidding us, said that while he was at it, Archie should have chartered a private coach, or even a train, to take us to Riding Mountain.	I didn't go all the way to Riding Mountain with Archie, because a mining man at Montebello had told me that the Elk Lake country (northern Ontario) was the place to go prospecting.
517	wu.89060396363	00000166	We left Riding Mountain on October 26, 1931.	It was a worrisome trip, but happily, our family – Jelly Roll, Rawhide, Wakanee and Wakanoo, Silver Bells, and Buckshot arrived at Ajawaan on the first of November in good condition; only Archie and I weren't!	We named our new home Beaver Lodge.
518	wu.89060396363	00000172	It was at the suggestion of Mr. Charlie Walrod, a game-warden friend of ours, that Archie had gone to Mrs. Winters to ask her to teach me baby care.	I won't elaborate on the close relationship that existed between the Winters family and ours, as I will never be able to put into words our deep appreciation for Mrs. Winters' devotion to Shirley Dawn.	We have been fast friends for thirty-four years.
519	wu.89060396363	00000173	I wanted to be sure that the stuff got to Ajawaan before I did, because I didn't want to be there when Archie got the bill.	In the time that we were in Prince Albert, Mrs. Winters had become very attached to the baby and was worried about my taking Dawn so far into the woods to Ajawaan.	But when she saw that I was bound to go, she told me that Archie had arranged for a girl to go in with me as a companion.
520	wu.89060396363	00000167	Near the end of November the lake froze over, and it was now safe to let the beaver out.	We lifted the barricade to the plunge-hole, and as soon as we did, Rawhide took to it like blue lightning.	Now was his chance, he thought, to see to his family's needs; but he was ice-locked and would be until spring.
521	wu.89060396363	00000163	I was scolding him for doing such a stupid thing when he handed me a letter.	The letter was from a representative of the Minister of the Interior of the federal government in Ottawa, stating that Archie now had a position as 'naturalist.	The Minister's offer was of considerable consequence, since it was not only giving us a place to live, but, what was more important, a sanctuary for the beaver.
522	wu.89060396363	00000148	I let it go at that.	Mr. Bell was from Arizona, and the evening passed all too quickly as I sat listening to his experiences in South America, Egypt, and other places.	The next morning, after breakfast, I was lashing up the toboggan tarp when Mr. Bell came and asked, “What's all the rush?
523	wu.89060396363	00000161	But I only kicked him, none too gently.	'Gurdy,' he said imploringly, 'I wish you wouldn't keep kicking me under the table like that.'	'I was doing the same thing to Jack – he keeps interrupting Grey Owl so,' said Mrs. Flagstone, lying beautifully.
524	wu.89060396363	00000144	One hundred and eighty dollars!	No, the only road open to me was to walk out to Oskelaneo, eighty miles, and work my way back to Cabano.	I knew that Archie hadn't any money to send me.
525	wu.89060396363	00000145	You'll need one and so will I.'	After a long session of coaxing and arguing about my trapping, Dave gave up and said that he could get a canoe from Chibougamau Prospectors Ltd., one of the drilling outfits he worked for.	I was all for pulling out in the middle of the night, so I could begin putting up the log walls for my shack-tent, but Dave refused to listen.
526	wu.89060396363	00000151	The plane was unloaded in jig time, for those who were impatient to take off dumped the stuff off like dirt, that is, except for one large item a sixty-gallon barrel of beer.	'For heaven's sake, who sent that in?' asked Mr. Bell, astonished.	‘The Chibougamau Prospectors,' said the pilot.
527	wu.89060396363	00000147	The first stop was to be Merril Island, where I hoped to see Dave and get some idea of the winter route out.	Should he not be there, I would then have to go to the Hudson's Bay factor at Lake Chibougamau, eight miles to the south, to get the necessary information.	It was seventeen miles to Merril Island, but on glare ice one step ahead, two steps back – it added up to fifty-one miles.
528	wu.89060396363	00000152	If he'd had it, I would have been on that plane flying home to Archie and Jelly Roll.	Gillman appointed me caretaker, and he said before he left, 'Sell everything and anything that you can.'	But there were no buyers!
529	wu.89060396363	00000142	He was back almost immediately, very agitated.	'Pony,' he said, 'some prospectors have made a strike at Opemiska.	I'm worried.
530	wu.89060396363	00000156	People from as far away as New York and Vancouver came to see Nels Nelson, then the world's champion skier, take the 263-foot ski-jump on New Year's Day.	On Christmas Eve, our boss had said that we of the sports staff were to bring in the New Year and take out the old, so as midnight approached, we were outside of the lodge, taking our places for the march around the fireplace.	Nels, on skis, was to lead the parade; after him would come the ski instructors, also on skis, followed by the toboggan and bob-sled pilots with a toboggan and sled; then the riding major and finally the dogs with the ‘New Year', a cute, curly-headed infant, in the carriole.
531	wu.89060396363	00000157	Then one night in February I received a telegram from Archie asking me to meet him in Montreal, at once.	I was to go to the Windsor Hotel and ask for Grey Owl.	I arrived in Montreal the next morning and was taken to Archie's suite, where I found him with Sir Charles Delmé Radcliff.
532	wu.89060396363	00000143	When faced with a tough situation, he wasted no time in fretting.	The moment we returned to Lac Dore he got a job as a hunter, supplying three diamond-drilling camps with fish, moose and caribou meat.	To Dave the problem of eating was solved, but to me the idea of living off the old fellow's hard-earned cash was unthinkable.
533	wu.89060396363	00000169	Jelly Roll was our most frequent customer; the others, it seemed, were satisfied with their natural diet.	What with Archie at his book, I at my mineralogy studies, and the heavy construction going on below as Rawhide enlarged the house, Beaver Lodge was a going concern.	In the latter part of February all activity came to an abrupt halt – because I had vomited.
534	wu.89060396363	00000155	'That's what I mean.	If Mrs. Grahame will take a chance on my selling the book, she'll get paid; if not . . . .	'He let it go at that.
535	wu.89060396363	00000141	The prospects of a gold mine blasted into thin air.	It would take a fortune to re-ship our canoe and camping equipment back to Cabano – both had already gone ahead of us to Oskelaneo.	To leave without knowing what had become of Dave was unthinkable.
536	wu.89060396363	00000140	Dave went to the bar.	He spoke French fluently and could get along with the French Canadians very well – too well, in fact.	I heard him and several others singing, laughing, and kicking up their heels in the parking-lot at the rear of the hotel about midnight.
537	wu.89060396363	00000047	"""Oh for Christ's sake, what happened to Mary Robinson?"	In what part of Canada did this take place?	Did it happen in the War of 1812?
538	wu.89060396363	00000090	While all heads were bowed in prayer, the chief reached out and solemnly joined Archie's hand in mine across the table.	My thoughts raced back to Mary Robinson and Kanistonou.	When the prayer ended, Archie and I bowed our thanks to the good people, and Archie again congratulated the old man on his long and happy life with the Beaver Woman.
539	wu.89060396363	00000133	He glared in disbelief.	His expression unnerved me, and I said almost guiltily, “Yes,' and then sputtered on about how she had specified a Scandinavian maid.	'This is awful – it gets worse all the time.'
540	wu.89060396363	00000132	I did.	Mrs. Peck read it with mounting interest.	She reached for the phone and called her mother.
541	wu.89060396363	00000085	Later, in bed in my cabin, I simply could not settle down.	I was disturbed at the tiff between Papati and the priest.	Then I heard Archie stir and call out to me.
542	wu.89060396363	00000052	They were delicious.	Another delicacy that Grandmother devised was to split a turnip in two and then scrape out the juicy meat with a knife, all the time telling more of her stories.	But all good things must come to an end, and so did this.
543	wu.89060396363	00000046	'The Iroquois are the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, and Tuscaroras.	They – the Tuscaroras – were the last to join us, and then we became the Six Nations.'	Archie exclaimed, 'Well, how about that?
544	wu.89060396363	00000050	Grandmother married in Oka and soon afterward she and her husband secretly stole away from the oppression and poverty there.	They took almost the same trail as had Naharrenou – they too had to travel off the beaten trail – and this led them to where Belleville is now, or just north of it.	There they remained for twenty-five years and raised a family of eleven.
545	wu.89060396363	00000093	Without a word he led me upstairs to a room.	Hingy was really ill.	'I must get a doctor,' I said in panic, but I had no luck.
546	wu.89060396363	00000118	He'd brought things that he didn't want them to see until later, so he gave them each a candy stick, and while they were distracted with these he showed me the toys he'd bought them.	There was a clown on wheels that made a noisy clack-clack when pulled by its long orange-coloured handle, a bunny with a tinkly bell, also on wheels, and, to my surprise and delight, he'd also bought yards and yards of red and white crepe-paper streamers, a Chinese lantern for the ceiling, and red, green, and silver baubles for the window.	I could hardly wait to start the festivities, so as soon as I'd whipped up a quick meal for Archie, I lost no time in getting at the decorations.
547	wu.89060396363	00000131	The villainous jinx that had urged Dave to trap our beaver that day in March was still dogging our trail.	Not being satisfied with this first outrage, nor with the subsequent loss of McGinnis and McGinty, it also took little Sugar Loaf.	This pitiful creature died less than three weeks after we got him.
548	wu.89060396363	00000086	‘But we've got to,' Archie exclaimed.	'Yes go,' Miranda urged.	On hearing Archie's voice, Papati got up and lit a candle.
549	wu.89060396363	00000092	The reporter had made the story a real heart-breaker.	He also named the place where I should be contacted in case Hingy was found, and, as a consequence, Mr. Ring's restaurant did a booming business.	Everyone wanted to see the 'waitress wolf-girl.
550	wu.89060396363	00000045	However, his first question got the ball rolling.	'Your father told me that you were Iroquois.	Is that right?
551	wu.89060396363	00000051	Then there was her book.	Grandma had learned to speak her own language only after she left the convent, but she'd always yearned to translate prayers, history, and little anecdotes, etc., from the French into Mohawk.	She was a middle-aged woman before she was able to accomplish this.
552	wu.89060396363	00000069	She was beautiful.	She toured all over Europe, South America, and, of course, England.	She was a great performer.'
553	wu.89060396363	00000082	The Lac Simon Indians gave Archie all the credit for this light term and, immediately after the trial, they invited him to their summer place to see if he could iron out a few troubled spots there.	We launched the canoe out of Senneterre into the Nottaway River, bound for Lac Simon, some sixty miles in.	It was a lovely day, and we reached there in no time, for Nuna had a powerful outboard motor.
554	wu.89060396363	00000134	I'd make a fool of myself – a bigger fool than I am.'	'Now you stop this nonsense, Mr. Belaney.'	Mrs. Peck advanced upon him purposefully, fishing the manuscript from her purse.
555	wu.89060396363	00000120	She planted herself solidly between him and the tree, but McGinnis, out to get his share of the goodies, gave her a push that sent her sprawling.	McGinnis plucked a big, fat prune from the tree just as McGinty came bounding back.	With a quick flip of her short little arm, she whisked the prune from his grasp, and it sailed across the floor.
556	wu.89060396363	00000108	Dave arrived from town with a man whom we shall call Joe.	Joe was a Micmac Indian, from eastern Quebec and New Brunswick, he said.	We had no reason to doubt this, but the balance of what he told us was pure fabrication.
557	wu.89060396363	00000068	This time for good.	In the first place, most of the old-timers in Timagami advised me against marrying her, said she was wild, and so on.	A child was born seven months after we were married, if that means anything.
558	wu.89060396363	00000056	I said that I had a ball playing hooky, but this isn't true.	I had been too long with Grandma, a religious, strait-laced woman, for my conscience to be quieted so easily, and each time it pointed an accusing finger at me I'd look for something worse to do, hoping that it would go away.	I started swimming with the boys down at the sand bar.
559	wu.89060396363	00000081	Just like in the story books, eh?	But something came up and we didn't get married in Doucet after all.	The next morning, hand in hand, we went to the station to get a refund on my ticket home.
560	wu.89060396363	00000122	‘Oh, for heaven sakes, open it up,' I cried impatiently, as 1 tried unsuccessfully to get at the magazine.	'It's from England,' said Archie, mystified.	He slit the envelope open with his hunting-knife and pulled out a letter.
